  Discuss your choices with your instructor. Make sure your selections are 
  clearly marked on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/Choose_an_Article?veaction=edit&preload=Template:Dashboard.wikiedu.org_choose_article)
  along with your notes to improve the articles.

  Start compiling a list of relevant, reliable books, journal articles, or other
  sources. You can keep a running list of these sources in your bibliography
  to reference easily when you start writing. Your bibliography can be found by
  going to the My Articles section and clicking on the Bibliography link underneath
  the article you are working on.

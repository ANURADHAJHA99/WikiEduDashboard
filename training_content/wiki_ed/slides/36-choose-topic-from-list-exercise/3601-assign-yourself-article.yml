  Your professor has compiled a list of articles for you to choose from for your
  Wikipedia assignment. On your course's main page, assign yourself one of these
  articles by clicking on the "Assign myself an article" button in the My Articles
  section. You should then be able to select an article from the dropdown list
  that appears.

  If you're working in a group, have one person assign themselves the article. 
  Each additional group member should then copy the URL or title of the article
  you've chosen and add it to the input box under the "Assign myself an article"
  button.
